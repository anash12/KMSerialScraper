# KMSerialScraper

Wrote this script in a few minutes to help with a project at work. Scrapes Konica Minolta printer web interface for it's serial number and outputs it to a CSV file. this works on the most recent Konica Minolta firmware.
# The script requires a list of IP addresses within a CSV file to work. The best way to do this is create a CSV file with each row as a printer. Add a column for IP addresses.
